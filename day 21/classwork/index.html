                    <h2>History Of Manchester United</h2>
                    <p>Manchester United was formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club 
                        by the Carriage and Wagon department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) depot at Newton Heath.[16] The team initially played games against other departments 
                        and railway companies, but on 20 November 1880, they com
                        peted in their f Heath joined the newly formed 'Football Alliance', which ran for three seasons before being merged with The Football League. This resulted in
                         the club starting the 1892–93 season in the First Division, by which time it had become independent of the railway company and dropped the "LYR" from its name.[16]
                         After two seasons, the club was relegated to the Second Division.[16]</p>

                <p>In January 1902, with debts of £2,670 – equivalent to £370,000 in 2024[nb 1] – the club was served with a winding-up order.[18] Captain Harry 
                    Stafford found four local businessmen, including John Henry Davies (who became club president), each willing to invest £500 
                    in return for a direct interest in running the club and who subsequently changed the name;[19] on 24 April 1902, Manchester United was officially born.[20][nb 2]
                     Under Ernest Mangnall, who assumed managerial
                     duties in 1903, the team finished as Second Division runners-up in 1906 and secured promotion to the First Division, which they won in 1908 – the club's first league title</p>

                        <P>The following season, on the way home from a European Cup quarter-final victory against Red Star Belgrade, the aircraft carrying the Manchester United players, officials and journalists crashed
                             while attempting to take off
                             after refuelling in Munich, Germany. The Munich air disaster of 6 February 1958 claimed 23 lives, including those of eight players – Geoff Bent, Roger Byrne, Eddie Colman, Duncan Edwards,
                              Mark Jones, David Pegg, Tommy Taylor and Billy Whelan – 
                             and injured several more.[29][30]</P>

                    <h2>Grounds</h2>
                    <p>Newton Heath initially played on a field on North Road, close to the railway yard; the original capacity was about 12,000, but club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club hoping to join The Football League.[112] Some expansion took
                         place in 1887, and in 1891, Newton Heath used its minimal financial reserves to purchase two
                         grandstands, each able to hold 1,000 spectators.[113] Although attendances were not recorded for many of the earliest matches at North Road, the highest documented attendance was 
                         approximately 15,000 for a First Division match against Sunderland on 4 March 1893.[114] A similar attendance was also recorded for a friendly match against Gorton Villa on 5 September 1889.[115]</p>

            <footer>Following Manchester United's first league title in 1908 and the FA Cup a year later, it was decided that Bank Street was too restrictive for Davies' ambition;[119] in February 1909, six weeks before the 
                club's first FA Cup title, Old Trafford was named 
                as the home of Manchester United, following the purchase of land for around £60,000. Architect Archibald Leitch was given a budget of £30,000 for construction; original plans called for seating capacity 
                of 100,000, though budget constraints forced a</footer>
